 Ok, I've reviewed everything. For the most part it looks good. Most of my comments are on small swift convention
 type things.
 Architecturally I'd say watch out for your ViewControllers getting too big, they end up being a dumping
 ground for code that doesn't fit elsewhere.
 Also try to avoid duplicating code because it will become a hassle to maintain.
 I kept my comments pretty short so if there's anything that doesn't make sense just shoot me an email.

 Tips:
 Usually good to set "treat warnings as errors" in the project settings, it forces developers to fix warnings too
 Check out Cocoapods once you start integrating 3rd party libraries and code into your projects. It makes adding that stuff super easy.
